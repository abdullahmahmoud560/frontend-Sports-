- `inactivePlayersData`: Array of inactive players
- `hasDataLoaded`: Boolean indicating if initial data load is complete

### UI States
- `selectedView`: Current view mode ('active', 'inactive', 'both')
- `searchTerm`: Current search filter text
- `selectedCategory`: Current category filter
- `isLoading`: Loading state indicator
- `error`: Error message if API calls fail

## API Integration

### Authentication
The component uses JWT token authentication stored in localStorage:
```javascript
const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
```

### Error Handling
- **Network Errors**: Displays user-friendly error messages
- **Authentication Errors**: Prompts for re-login if token is missing/invalid
- **API Errors**: Shows specific error messages with retry options

### Data Processing
The component handles various data formats and safely accesses player properties:
- Supports both `name` and `playerName` fields
- Handles missing or null values gracefully
- Provides fallbacks for undefined properties

### Player Status Filtering
The component automatically filters players from the single API response:
- **Active Players**: `player.isActive === true` OR `player.status === 'active'` OR `player.active === true`
- **Inactive Players**: `player.isActive === false` OR `player.status === 'inactive'` OR `player.active === false` OR players with no status field
- **Frontend Processing**: All filtering happens on the client side for better performance

### Edit Functionality
The edit feature is restricted to inactive players only:
- **Player Selection**: Edit button appears only for inactive players
- **Form Pre-population**: All existing player data is loaded into the form
- **Image Handling**: 
  - Supports profile and passport image uploads
  - Real-time image preview with edit/remove options
  - File validation (JPEG, PNG, GIF, max 5MB)
  - FormData submission for file uploads
- **Real-time Updates**: Local state updates immediately upon successful API call
- **Status Change**: Players can be moved from inactive to active status
- **Validation**: Form validation ensures data integrity before submission

## Usage Example

```jsx
import ActiveNoActive from './componant/Pages/ActiveNoActive/ActiveNoActive';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ActiveNoActive />
